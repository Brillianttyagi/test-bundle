### Airflow DAG with Independent Tasks

This DAG is designed to showcase a simple workflow where numerous tasks are defined
but none have any dependencies on each other. When this DAG is triggered, the Airflow
scheduler is free to execute all tasks concurrently, depending on the available
resources (executor slots) in the Airflow environment.
